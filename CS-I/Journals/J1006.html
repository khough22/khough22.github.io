    <h3>Question 1. What is Git communicating to you?</h3>
    <p>Branch 'master doesnt have any commits.</p>

    <p>No, because file 2 hasn't been commited.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that source control helps manage changes to our codes.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when trying to see the files show up.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by doing the right git commands in order.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that there are new ways to manage and track the new codes that you make.</p>
