    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. Name at least two other services that you personally use which implemented using a Client/Server Model</h3>
    <p>Spotify and Discord.</p>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. Do you think the ability to have two different users creat a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
    <p>I think that the ability to have two different users is very important because if two people want to have the same directory it can be done.</p>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. Why do you think the home directory had a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
    <p>It can be used quickly and it can be accessed easily.</p>  
    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
    <p>Yes, it added /Merlin to the prompt. You can use it if you want to add something to the prompt temporarily.</p>
    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. What happens each time you press the up key?</h3>
    <p>It goes to the command you used above.</p>
    <h3>Question 2. What happens each time you press the down arrow?</h3>
    <p>It goes to the command below or back to the original prompt.
    <h2>Section 6</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p>No, because it got moved to another file.</p>
    <h2>Section 7</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. How does the 'ls' command differ from the tree command?</h3>
    <p>The tree command shows whats included in every directory</p>
    <h3>Question 2. How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
    <p>If you want to know what is inside of each directory, use the tree command. If you want to use to see what is just inside the directory you are in the use the ls command.</p>
    <h2>Section 8</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
    <p>Application that aren't currently in use.</p>
    <h3>Question 2. Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
    <p>See how many applications there are in total.</p>
    <h2>Section 9</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
    <p>It shows a large number in brackets.</p>
    <h3>Question 2. What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p>How many applications are running in the background.</p>
    <h3>Question 3. What do you think the number displayed in the brackets specifies?</h3>
    <p>The amount of times the application is used.</p>  
    <h2>Section 10</h2>
    <h3>Question 1. What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
    <p>It shows the sleep commands I used and that they are done.</p>
    <h3>Question 2. How do you explain you observations?</h3>
    <p>It shows the command and + for the current job and - for the previous job.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to get around Tabby and different commands. The big idea is how directories work and the uses of different commands.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I struggled with the difference between the use of tab and enter.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>Remembering that tab is used to auto fill a command and enter is to execute the command.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection:</h2>
    <p>I found out that the mouse isn't used very much during coding.</p>
